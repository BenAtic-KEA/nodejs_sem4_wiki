                        This site is made from SSR, which means the DOM is send in its final form
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When using SSR your server handle all the work before sending the dom, 
                        this can be effective because you only rely on your server internet connection and not the clients
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The downside is that the server has to redo all the rendering for each request,
                        this can be a challenge for the server if your suddenly get alot of traffic that could increase the loadtime.

                        With CSR you make the client render the site.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is done by the server only sending a single HTML file,
                        in which your client will fetch all the JavaScript and compile it in the browser.    
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The problem can be that the rendering rely on the clients internet and that could reduce the speed of the rendering.
                        Since the clients internet connection is a unknown factor you cant control.
